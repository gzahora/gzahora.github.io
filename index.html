            <p>My name is Greg Zahora and after 4 years as a financial analyst working in interest rate/liquidity risk and equity research I am working on becoming a software developer. In my previous career I realized that the times I was most engaged was when I was automating excel spreadsheets and create complicated nested if statements, leading me to the realization that I was in the wrong industry, which led me to quit finance all together and work to become a software developer.</p>
            <p>In my free time I like to be outdoors hiking and camping; I try to spend at least a week a year on a major hiking/camping trip. I've been to eight North American national parks with my favorites being Zion National Park and Banff National Park.</p>
            <p> I try to spend my more-limited daily free time keeping up with current events and geopolitical affairs. It's a goal of mine to be informed enough to be able to have a conversation about any subject. I'm getting close... but am lacking most in the pop-culture department.</p>
